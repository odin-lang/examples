	// This `>` thing is called a comparison operator. Odin has a bunch of
	// comparison operators. All of them result in a value of type `bool`, short

	// There's a list of all comparison operators here:
	// https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#comparison-operators
	//
	// You can assign the result of the comparison operator to a variable. Note
	// how we don't write any type: It's inferred to being of type `bool`:
	a_condition := some_number < 500

	// This will print.
	if a_condition {
		fmt.println("some_number is less than 500")
