# Odin Examples

This repository contains examples of how certain things can be accomplished in idiomatic [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin), allowing you learn its semantics, as well as how to use parts of the `core` and `vendor` package collections.

The code examples are published in the hope they are found useful, and are in the [Public Domain](https://unlicense.org) or under [Odin's BSD-3 license](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/LICENSE), per your choice.

Assets and third-party libraries are provided under their own license. If in doubt, check the `LICENSE*` and `COPYING*` file(s) in a particular directory for clarification.
